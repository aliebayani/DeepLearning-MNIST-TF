# TensorFlow MNIST Classifier

## Overview

This repository contains code for a machine learning exercise completed as part of my university course (2020). The project focuses on building a classifier for the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning library.

## Files

- `data.py`: Deprecated functions for downloading and reading MNIST data.
- `dataset.py`: TensorFlow Dataset interface for the MNIST dataset.
- `mnist.py`: TensorFlow-based MNIST classifier implementation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aliebayani/DeepLearning-MNIST-TF.git
   cd DeepLearning-MNIST-TF

2. Install dependencies:
## Assuming you have TensorFlow installed
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Explore the code and run the MNIST classifier:
   python mnist.py
